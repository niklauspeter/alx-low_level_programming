/**
 * jump_search - function searches for value
 * in a sorted array of integers
 *
 * @array: pointer to the first element of the array to search in
 * @size:  number of elements in array
 * @value: the value being searched for
 * Return: the first index where value is located
 *
* Your function must return the first index
* Where value is located
* You can assume that array will be sorted in ascending order
* If value is not present in array or if array is NULL,
* your function must return -1
* You have to use the square root of the size of the array
* as the jump step.
* You can use the sqrt() function included in <math.h>
* (donâ€™t forget to compile with -lm)
* Every time you compare a value in the array
* to the value you are searching for,
* you have to print this value (see example)
